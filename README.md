# Vehicle_cut_in_detection_and_Warnning_system
 This repository contains a project for real-time vehicle cut-in detection and collision warning system using YOLOv8 for object detection and SORT for object tracking. The system is designed to process dashcam video footage to detect vehicles cutting into the lane, calculate their relative speed, and estimate time-to-collision (TTC). If a potential collision is detected, the system issues a warning.
